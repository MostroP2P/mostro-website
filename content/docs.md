We started this project writing how the communication will be made between parties, we called that our version `0`, then we coded on top of it, that worked great but while we went forward we found the need to update the specs and keep improving the communication, that's why we created a new site where you can find the version `0` of the Mostro specifications for clients, this is a work in progress and will be updated as we move forward to version `1`, if you want to play with it now you can start from here.
